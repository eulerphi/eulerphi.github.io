        <h1>02: Quality Time</h1>
        <p>Quality Time is an early childhood literacy app focused on explicitly and systematically teaching the skills
            of
            reading (e.g., phonological awareness, decoding, and sight recognition.) The mission is to democratize
            access to
            evidence-based instruction and raise the percentage of proficient US 4th grade readers from 33% [1] to an
            estimated 94% [2][3]. It differs from existing offerings in three key ways.</p>

        <p>First, it is designed for and depends on the participation of a caregiver. Although the perception is that
            caregivers are too busy, there is strong and abundant evidence [4] that caregivers, across cultural,
            linguistic,
            and class backgrounds, value their children’s education and want to help. The true problem is they lack the
            knowledge and skill to effectively and confidently do so [5].</p>

        <p>Second, Quality Time can, with a caregiver’s assistance, understand the nuance of a learner’s response and,
            like
            an expert tutor, respond with real-time, targeted feedback. For example, when a child blends “side
            &lt;pause&gt;
            walk” into “sidewalk,” it is trivial for an adult to classify the response as Repeat, No Response, Too Loud,
            Too
            Slow, or Good [7]. This model of guiding and empowering a non-traditional teacher parallels a stunningly
            successful program started in Kenya (effect size = 1.35) [8] and unlocks a level of adaptiveness and
            personalization that ensures the success of both child and caregiver.</p>

        <p>Third, by guaranteeing success, Quality Time systematically builds the self-concepts of both child and
            caregiver
            and strengthens their relationship. The experience of learning to read proves to the child that he or she is
            “a
            reader” and can succeed academically. For the caregiver, the experience demonstrates that they have a
            valuable
            role to play in their child’s academic development.</p>

        <p>Although this project might seem like an impossible moonshot, literacy is the most studied subject in human
            learning and the research is clear-cut. We know that ~30% of children will learn to read regardless of
            method,
            ~50% require explicit, systematic instruction, ~15% require prolonged explicit and systematic instruction,
            and
            up to 6% have severe cognitive impairments that make acquiring reading skills extremely difficult [2]. Yet,
            the
            status quo knowingly entails that over 60% of US fourth-graders, through no fault of their own, are
            disproportionately at-risk to drop out of high school [9], to end up incarcerated [10], and to live in
            poverty
            [11]. This is inexcusable.</p>

        <p>Ideally, the school system would teach every child the skills of reading. Although there are localized
            success
            stories, numerous studies indicate that most early childhood teachers lack the deep knowledge necessary to
            effectively teach reading [12][13]. Worse still, teacher preparation programs are often not teaching the
            science
            [14] and even sometimes resistant to it [15]. Hopefully, as the science of reading permeates common
            knowledge,
            society will demand that teachers receive the training they require to provide the reading instruction
            children
            deserve.</p>

        <p>Lastly, although there is no shortage of consumer edtech apps that ostensibly teach reading, they are
            designed
            for a child to use alone and employ a touch-centric design. This is a problem because the natural user
            interface
            of reading is phonetic [16]. For example, how can an app teach that the grapheme “ee” corresponds to the
            long e
            sound without understanding if a child accurately vocalizes it? This limitation necessitates an implicit
            instructional approach that, as mentioned, only helps the ~30% of students that will learn regardless.</p>

                project is for every child to reach NAEP’s Proficient, which requires more than just the skills of
                reading.
